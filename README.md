URL Phishing Attack Detection System Using NLP

Cybercrime is the bane of technology and computer networks, instilling anxiety in everyone who uses computers and the internet. While traditional crimes are on the decline, cybercrime is on the rise, with activities such as hacking, cyberstalking, denial of service, and phishing. Phishing assaults are a kind of social engineering, and they are one of the most common types of cybercrime that most people are exposed to. Blacklists, which are lists of phishing URLs, have traditionally been used to detect phishing URLs. However, this method has a drawback in that new phishing URLs that aren't on the blacklist can't be avoided. A unique approach based on Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing is proposed to detect freshly discovered phishing URLs. As a result, Deep Learning algorithms and Natural Language Processing techniques are used to create and develop a real-time anti-phishing system that understands the core semantic pattern differences between phishing and valid URLs. This method, which employed the Deep Learning algorithm, yielded a promising accuracy of 96.69 percent.
